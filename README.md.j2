# reveal
Reveal source code line-by-line in LaTeX presentations.

{% macro slide(name, num) -%}
<p align="center"><img src="{% include 'slides/' + name + '-' + num + '.imgur' %}" width="80%" /></p>
{%- endmacro %}

{% macro code(name, lang="go") -%}
```{{ lang }}
{% include name %}
```
{%- endmacro %}

{{ slide("example", "2") }}

## Install

* Copy [`reveal.py`](reveal.py) and [`reveal.tex`](reveal.tex) into your project.
* Make sure you have [pygments](http://pygments.org/) installed with `pip install Pygments`.

## Getting Started

### Setup

Generate yourself style macros with

```
./reveal.py --style paraiso-dark style --output syntax.tex
```

Here we've chosen the `paraiso-dark` style, but you can choose anything
supported by pygments. See `pygmentize -L styles` for the full list.

Include the syntax macros and `reveal` headers in your LaTeX document with

```tex
\input{reveal.tex}
\input{syntax.tex}
```

### Including Source Code

Reveal understands special comments in source code at the end of each line,
starting with the prefix `//r`. The following example shows a "Hello World"
program in Go with reveal markup.

{{ code("samples/hello.go") }}

This markup specifies:

* There are three _stages_. The first is implicit, and displays all lines.
* The `import` line will be highlighted in stage 2.
* The `fmt.Println` line will be highlighted in stage 3.
* These lines also have inline comments specified for stages 2 and 3.

We can include this code in our slides with

```tex
\reveal{samples/hello.go}
```

{{ slide("example", "2") }}
{{ slide("example", "3") }}
{{ slide("example", "4") }}

### Snippets
